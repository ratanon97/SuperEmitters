# Techno-Economic Assessment of Options to Mitigate Super-Emitters in the Natural Gas Supply Chain

This is the README file of my MSc Advanced Chemical Engineering with Process Systems Engineering's thesis project in the academic year 2018-2019 of Imperial College London

This project was conducted under the [Sustainable Gas Institute](https://www.sustainablegasinstitute.org/) (SGI), part of Imperial College London. SGI incorporates world-class research in the themes of science, engineering, economics, policy and business to support the energy industry in hopes of transitioning into the low-carbon economy.
